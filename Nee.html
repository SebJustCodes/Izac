            <h3>Yuni's Bday Message</h3>
            <p>HELLOOOOO NEEEE!!</p>
            <p>HAPPY 19TH ANNIVERSARY OF WINNING THE SPERM RACE- ESTE- HAPPY BIRTHDAYYYYY!! 
                It hasn't been long since the first time we met but I really love how we got 
                comfortable of each other's energy quickly enough! I thank you sooo much as well 
                for the few times you listened and gave me your thoughts back when I vented to you. 
                I look forward to more marites sessions with you some time in the future huehuehuehue 
                (My dms will be open for you as well in case ya need a gal to talk with, mkay?) ~</p>
            <p>I really have not much to say but just my wishes to you~ Physically, 
                I hope you stay healthy and stay away from any sickness or illness! Getting sick 
                can get expensive. Emotionally and mentally, I hope you stay as mature as you are 
                and more as you grow up :heart: I hope you receive your needed wisdom, knowledge and 
                strength to overcome any hurdle that's coming your way! Overall, I hope you receive 
                all the blessings you deserve and despite the many struggles you may face not only 
                now, you'd still be able to strive and enjoy life as much as it offers. I LOVE YOUUUU 
                (platonically) AND MAY YOU HAVE A FRUITFUL TIME AHEAD~</p>
            <p>Ps. I purposely didn't greet you yet because I was waiting for Seb to give you this. Idk, that's just me AHAHAHAHA</p>
            <p>NOW PLEASE STOP CRYING- ILY MY BESTIE, I'M SORRY FOR NOT GREETING U EARLIER- I'm still that alpha sigma werewolf bestie for u AWOOOO- *dies*</p>
            <p>But seriously tho- Happy birthday!! Please don't forget me when we get busy with life eventually <//3</p>

            <p>Hey Izac, you have been an amazing friend to me when we met. I was honestly afraid you 
                wouldn't like me, but we got to become friends overtime and I am grateful we've met. 
                Thank you for making me feel welcome here in California.</p>
